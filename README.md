## Insanely simple and private peer-to-peer messaging app.

No Persistent Data: your chats and accounts are deleted as soon as you close the app.

No Servers: peer-to-peer communication - no data is processed or stored with third parties.

Simple Setup: generate an identifier, tell your buddy. That's how he/she will recognize you and you can start chatting.

Secure: end-to-end encryption assures your messages stay private.
